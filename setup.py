    This class is an ugly hack to a problem that arises when one must force
    a compiler to use specific flags by adding to the environment somethiing
    like the following:

        CXX="clang --some_flagA --some_flagB -I/usr/bin/include/mylibC"

    (as opposed to setting CXXFLAGS). Distutils in that case will complain
    that it cannot run the entire command as given because it is not
    found as an executable (specific error message is: "unable to execute...
    ... no such file or directory").

    This subclass of ``build_ext`` will extract the compiler name from the
    command line and insert any remaining arguments right after it.
